As a text-based AI, I do not have access to external files or databases. Therefore, I cannot provide you with the details of the "Cowboys" team from the database created by data_preparation_agent.


To get the information you need, you would require tools capable of:

1. **Accessing the Database:**  A tool that can read from the database where data_preparation_agent stored the information.
2. **Searching the Database:** A way to query the database specifically for information about the "Cowboys" team. 



Let me know if you have any other questions that don't require accessing external files or systems.
