I can't access or process files like the provided CSV. My abilities are limited to understanding and responding to your text prompts. To determine the team with the most injuries, you would need to open the CSV file in a program capable of reading and analyzing data, then write code or use spreadsheet functions to count injuries per team and identify the team with the highest count.
